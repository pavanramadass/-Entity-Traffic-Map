<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

When designing new buildings, architects must consider many factors when designing the interior workspaces and designs of the various rooms. During this time, they will often examine pre existing buildings to manually create foot traffic maps, which they can then incorporate into their own designs. The same is expected of Architecture students, who are required to examine academic buildings around campus to create their own foot maps. However, between other classes and a limited budget, architecture students do not have the same resources that professionals would have. This is where the entity detection system comes in.

Tabula Plena will be an entity recognizing application with an intended use of generating foot traffic maps for architecture students. This will come in especially handy for students (and architects in general) as it will greatly contribute to the research process that architects will undertake when designing new buildings. Without software present, architects would previously have to rely on their own personal data collection to determine foot traffic. This can be a grueling experience which can lead to inaccurate results, as it requires extreme concentration over a long period of time. Our project aims to automate this process to reduce human error and allow data collection to be happening at all times of the day.
